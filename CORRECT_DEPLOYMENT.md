# üöÄ MANUAL DEPLOYMENT TO YOUR CORRECT PROJECT

## **THE PROBLEM:**
- ‚ùå I deployed to `jegodigital-2ed98.web.app` (WRONG PROJECT)
- ‚úÖ You need: `ai-chatsy-390411.web.app` (YOUR PROJECT)

## **SOLUTION:**
Since I don't have CLI access to your `ai-chatsy-390411` project, you need to:

### **STEP 1: GO TO YOUR CORRECT FIREBASE CONSOLE**
1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ai-chatsy-390411/hosting
2. Look for "Upload files" or "Deploy" button

### **STEP 2: UPLOAD YOUR DASHBOARD**
1. Upload the file: `chatsy_dashboard_ready.html`
2. Rename it to `index.html`
3. Click "Deploy"

### **STEP 3: YOUR DASHBOARD WILL BE LIVE AT:**
- **https://ai-chatsy-390411.web.app** (YOUR CORRECT DOMAIN)

## **üéØ WHAT YOU'LL HAVE:**
‚úÖ Complete admin dashboard
‚úÖ All 51,129 users accessible
‚úÖ Real-time statistics
‚úÖ Firebase integration
‚úÖ Professional design

**I apologize for the confusion! Let's get this deployed to YOUR correct project!** üéØ
