# ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE - FIX THE 404 ERROR

## ðŸŽ¯ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**
Your file is uploaded correctly, but WordPress might be intercepting the request. I can see WordPress headers in the response.

## âœ… **SOLUTIONS TO TRY:**

### **SOLUTION 1: Check File Permissions**
1. **In cPanel File Manager**
2. **Right-click on `admin_dashboard.php`**
3. **Click "Permissions"**
4. **Set to 644** (if not already)
5. **Click "Change Permissions"**

### **SOLUTION 2: Clear Cache**
1. **In cPanel, look for "LiteSpeed Cache"**
2. **Clear all cache**
3. **Or wait 5-10 minutes for cache to expire**

### **SOLUTION 3: Try Different URL**
Instead of `admin_dashboard.php`, try:
- `https://aichatsy.com/admin_dashboard.php`
- `https://aichatsy.com/public_html/admin_dashboard.php`
- `https://aichatsy.com/?admin_dashboard.php`

### **SOLUTION 4: Check WordPress .htaccess**
The `.htaccess` file might be redirecting requests. Let's check:

1. **In File Manager, open `.htaccess`**
2. **Look for any redirects or rewrites**
3. **If you see WordPress rules, we might need to add an exception**

### **SOLUTION 5: Create a Simple Test File**
Let's test if PHP files work at all:

1. **Create a new file called `test.php`**
2. **Add this content:**
```php
<?php
echo "PHP is working!";
phpinfo();
?>
```
3. **Upload it to `public_html`**
4. **Test: `https://aichatsy.com/test.php`**

### **SOLUTION 6: Check Error Logs**
1. **In cPanel, look for "Error Logs"**
2. **Check for any PHP errors**
3. **Look for the specific error about admin_dashboard.php**

### **SOLUTION 7: Try Direct File Access**
1. **In File Manager, right-click `admin_dashboard.php`**
2. **Click "View" or "Edit"**
3. **Make sure the file content is correct**

## ðŸš€ **IMMEDIATE ACTION:**

### **Step 1: Test PHP**
Create a simple `test.php` file with just:
```php
<?php echo "Hello World!"; ?>
```

### **Step 2: Check Permissions**
Make sure `admin_dashboard.php` has 644 permissions

### **Step 3: Clear Cache**
Clear any caching in cPanel

### **Step 4: Try Alternative Access**
Try accessing via:
- Direct file path
- Different URL structure
- Bypass WordPress routing

## ðŸ†˜ **IF NOTHING WORKS:**

### **Contact Namecheap Support:**
1. **Live Chat:** Available 24/7
2. **Tell them:** "I uploaded a PHP file but getting 404 error"
3. **Ask them to:** Check file permissions and WordPress configuration

### **Alternative: Use phpMyAdmin Directly**
1. **In cPanel, click "phpMyAdmin"**
2. **Select your database** (likely `aichatsy_5`)
3. **Click on "users" table**
4. **View your users directly**

## ðŸŽ¯ **WHAT TO CHECK:**

- [ ] File permissions (644)
- [ ] File content (not corrupted)
- [ ] PHP is working (test.php)
- [ ] Cache cleared
- [ ] WordPress .htaccess rules
- [ ] Error logs

## ðŸ“ž **QUICK FIX:**

**The fastest solution might be to contact Namecheap support and ask them to:**
1. Check why PHP files are returning 404
2. Verify file permissions
3. Check WordPress configuration
4. Help you access your database directly
